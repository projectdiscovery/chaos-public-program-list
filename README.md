This is a source for programs available on [chaos.projectdiscovery.io](http://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/). Please send pull-request of public bug bounty programs that you want to include in our public list with recon data. 

We are currently accepting in JSON format, an example is below:

```json
{
   "name":"HackerOne",
   "url":"https://hackerone.com/security",
   "bounty":true,
   "domains":[
      "hackerone.com",
      "hackerone.net",
      "hacker101.com",
      "hackerone-ext-content.com"
   ]
}
```

**ðŸ“‹ Notes:**

- Only domain name values are accepted in the `domains` field.
- We do not support wildcard input like `*.tld` or `*.tld.*`.
- **domains** field includes TLD names associated with the target program, not based on scope of the program.
- Subdomains are populated using **Passive API** (chaos dataset). 

Thanks again for your contribution and keeping the community vibrant. :heart:
